"A1_String" = "Water temperature is an important value for a lot of people, e.g. swimmers, divers, fishermen and more. Until now, there was no reliable way of looking up real-time water temperature information. There are some sensor networks today, but they often don't provide multiple locations in one waterbody, or they just publish their measurements once a day. Now, we are building a network of cheap watertemperature sensors with very low engergy usage. This allows us to measure the temperatures locally and to provide them to you in real-time!";
